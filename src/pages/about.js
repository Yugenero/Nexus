				Hey! This blog is dedicated to my pursuit of writing and 
				affection for Software, Technology, and Lifestyle and serves as a canvas for my
				reflections, opinions, and personal musing, offering a platform to
				articulate thoughts that often evade expression in my day-to-day life. 
				The name Nexus represents the intersection of my interests and the
				connections I aim to foster in my life and work.
				<br/><br/>
				This space primarily encapsulates my own perspectives and experiences, and is, 
				in no way, a definitive resource on any of the topics I discuss. Instead, I aim 
				to be able to provide a novel perspective and value to those who engage with my content!
				<br/><br/>
				Opinions are my own. 
				<br/><br/>
				Thanks for stopping by! 
				<br/><br/>
				- Nelson
