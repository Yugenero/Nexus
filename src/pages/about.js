			<p> 
				Hey! This blog is dedicated to my pursuit of writing and 
				passion for CS, Technology, and Lifestyle.

				This blog serves as kind of a canvas for my personal musings,
				reflections, and opinions, offering
				a platform to articulate thoughts that often evade expression in my day-to-day life. 
				I think its important to note that this space primarily
				encapsulates my own perspectives and experiences, and is, in no way, a definitive
				resource on any of the topics I discuss. Instead, I aim to be able to provide
				a novel perspective and value to those who engage with my content!

				My opinions are my own,

				Thanks for stopping by!
			</p>
