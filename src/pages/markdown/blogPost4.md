# How I Made Nexus

Hey, my name is Nelson, I'm a recent graduate of computer science from <a style="color: #B3A369; font-family: 'Georgia'; font-weight: " href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/">Georgia Tech</a> where I concentrated in information networks and media applications and I just want to document and talk a little bit about my journey through the development of this blog.

This blog was developed using the **<span style="color:green">M</span><span style="color: orange">E</span><span style="color: turquoise">R</span><span style="color: lightgreen">N</span>** tech-stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and is arguably one of the most used (if not most) tech stacks in modern day web-development. 

I really created this blog for 2 purposes:

1. To learn **<span style="color:green">M</span><span style="color: orange">E</span><span style="color: turquoise">R</span><span style="color: lightgreen">N** in an applied environment
2. To write blogs like this!

When I started constructing this website, the only experience I had with **<span style="color:green">M</span><span style="color: orange">E</span><span style="color: turquoise">R</span><span style="color: lightgreen">N</span>** was React -- I had only created what was a really surface level personal portfolio website, which one might argue that using React was really overkill for the purpose it served. The thing that makes React so special is its ability to break down a web page into these things called components. For instance, if you have a header and a footer that is used in different instances of your webpage, you can componentize them into a function and simply do a functional call everytime you want to use them, this kind of modularity and resuability is what drew me to using React for the purpose of building a blogging webpage.
